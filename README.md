# playing_with_datasets_using_ML

This repo contains two simple projects to introduce python machine learning.
First both the datasets are trained using Naive Bayes algorithm.
Later feature extraction is carried out using sklearn.

I have run the commands using command prompt, for getting better tabular form output go ahead with jupyter notebook
